# Lox

My implementation of the Lox programming language by following [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

## Notes

The book implements two interpreters, one in Java and one in C.
At the moment I completed the Java one and working on cLox
(you can see in the last commit how far I got).

## Run jLox (IntelliJ IDEA)

1. Open the folder `jLox` in the IDE.
2. Navigate to the class `Lox` and run it.
3. You will now be prompted with a REPL.

## Run cLox (Unix only)

1. Compile with `make all`.
2. Run with `./clox`.
3. You will now be prompted with a REPL.
